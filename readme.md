# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.
You can verify docker is ready by running the following commands in your terminal: docker -v and docker-compose -v.
Then, run docker-compose up from the project root directory to load Anythink's backend and frontend.
If Docker is working correctly, the backend should be running and able to connect to your local database.
Let's test this by pointing your browser to http://localhost:3000/api/ping
Now, it’s time to check the frontend and make sure it’s connected to the backend.
If everything is working properly, you’ll be able to create a new user on http://localhost:3001/register
Create one (choose a cool nickname and everything) and you’ll be able to move to the next task.
Just make sure that you run all scripts in the next quests on one of the containers created by docker-compose up.  Also, you can use docker exec to run commands on a running container.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
